# Arduino UNO Projects 🚀


##  Projects Included

### 1. 🌙 Automatic Street Light

**Description:**
An automatic lighting system using an **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)** to detect ambient light levels. If the environment becomes dark, the system turns on a bulb (or LED); when it's bright, it turns it off automatically.

### 2. 🔐 Simple Security System

**Description:**
A motion-based security system using a **PIR (Passive Infrared)** sensor. It detects motion and triggers an alarm or turns on an LED as an alert.

---

### 3. 🌡️ Weather Monitor

**Description:**
Monitor **temperature and humidity** using a **DHT11** sensor and display the readings on the **Serial Monitor** or an **LCD display**.

**Working:**
- The DHT11 sensor reads temperature and humidity.
- Values are displayed on the Serial Monitor or LCD using the `DHT.h` and `LiquidCrystal.h` libraries.

### 4. 📡 Radar System with Arduino

**Description:**
A basic radar simulation using a **servo motor** and **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor**. The system scans the surroundings by rotating the sensor and visualizes detected objects on a **radar-like interface** using the **Processing IDE**.
