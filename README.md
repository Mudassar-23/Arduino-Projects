Arduino UNO Project

=> Automatic Street Light

We use LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) Sensor with Arduino so that we can detect intensity of light. Based on this we can turn on/off bulb automatically if surrounding is dark or bright.



=> Simple Security System

Use a PIR sensor to detect motion and trigger an alarm or LED.


=> Weather Monitor

 Use an DHT11 sensor to read temperature and humidity.

 Display on the Serial Monitor ond LCD.
